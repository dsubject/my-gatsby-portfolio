  My Low-Carbon Website
</h1>

## Welcome to my site

This website was built to be as small as possible. Each page visit produces [0.04g of CO2](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/daniellesubject-com/), compared to the website average of 1.76 grams of CO2 per page visit. You can read more about the process behind building this blog [here](https://daniellesubject.com/blog/green-web-design).

This site supports a Jamstack. It was built using a static site generator called [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and is deployed by [Netlify](netlify.com).
